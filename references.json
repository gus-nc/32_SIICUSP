		"abstract": "Interactions connect the units of ecological systems, forming networks. Individual-based networks characterize variation in niches among individuals within populations. These individual-based networks merge with each other, forming species-based networks and food webs that describe the architecture of ecological communities. Networks at broader spatiotemporal scales portray the structure of ecological interactions across landscapes and over macroevolutionary time. Here, I review the patterns observed in ecological networks across multiple levels of biological organization. A fundamental challenge is to understand the amount of interdependence as we move from individual-based networks to species-based networks and beyond. Despite the uneven distribution of studies, regularities in network structure emerge across scales due to the fundamental architectural patterns shared by complex networks and the interplay between traits and numerical effects. I illustrate the integration of these organizational scales by exploring the consequences of the emergence of highly connected species for network structures across scales.",

But, most species appear to have weak interactions with other species (Wootton and Emmerson, 2005). These attributes tend to be repeatable among diﬀerent kinds of food webs suggesting that there may be emerging regularity in food web properties. This arises perhaps because highly interconnected systems with a few strong interactors combined with many weak interactors tend to be architecturally the most robust structures in Nature.",

		"abstract": "The specialization of ecological networks provides important insights into possible consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning. However, mostly mutualistic and antagonistic interactions of living organisms have been studied, whereas detritivore networks and their successional changes are largely unexplored. We studied the interactions of saproxylic (deadwood-dependent) beetles with their dead host trees. In a large-scale experiment, 764 logs of 13 tree species were exposed to analyse network structure of three trophic groups of saproxylic beetles over 3 successional years. We found remarkably high specialization of deadwood-feeding xylophages and lower specialization of fungivorous and predatory species. During deadwood succession, community composition, network specialization and network robustness changed differently for the functional groups. To reveal potential drivers of network specialization, we linked species' functional traits to their network roles, and tested for trait matching between plant (i.e. chemical compounds) and beetle (i.e. body size) traits. We found that both plant and animal traits are major drivers of species specialization, and that trait matching can be more important in explaining interactions than neutral processes reflecting species abundance distributions. High network specialization in the early successional stage and decreasing network robustness during succession indicate vulnerability of detritivore networks to reduced tree species diversity and beetle extinctions, with unknown consequences for wood decomposition and nutrient cycling.",

		"abstract": "The interaction among species can be inﬂuenced by neutral processes, in which more abundant species have high effect on the structure of interaction, or can be inﬂuenced by trait matching. Despite both variables (abundance and species traits) inﬂuencing the interaction of species in mutualistic networks, few studies showed their importance in antagonistic networks. Here, we posed the question: what are the main predictors of the liana–tree interactions: species abundance, biological traits or both? In a savanna woodland fragment in south-eastern Brazil, we sampled lianas and trees in 1 ha, where we recorded the abundance, maximum height and bark roughness of tree species, as well as abundance, maximum diameter and climbing system of liana species. For each species, we calculated their contribution to nestedness (ni), which is a measure of network structure, and performed simple linear regressions between ni and abundance and species traits. Abundant species contribute more to ni than rare species, indicating that neutral processes affect interactions between lianas and trees, probably because lianas are opportunistic and climb trees in their neighbourhood. The only trait related to ni was tree height, which can indicate that light availability can have a considerable role on network structure between both growth forms. Therefore, the importance of species abundance and tree height can be related to opportunism of lianas on climbing the most suitable tree in their neighbourhood.",

		"abstract": "While niche-based processes have been invoked extensively to explain the structure of interaction networks, recent studies propose that neutrality could also be of great importance. Under the neutral hypothesis, network structure would simply emerge from random encounters between individuals and thus would be directly linked to species abundance. We investigated the impact of species abundance distributions on qualitative and quantitative metrics of 113 host-parasite networks. We analyzed the concordance between neutral expectations and empirical observations at interaction, species, and network levels. We found that species abundance accurately predicts network metrics at all levels. Despite host-parasite systems being constrained by physiology and immunology, our results suggest that neutrality could also explain, at least partially, their structure. We hypothesize that trait matching would determine potential interactions between species, while abundance would determine their realization.",

		"abstract": "Background: Plant-pollinator mutualistic networks show non-random structural properties that promote species coexistence. However, these networks show high variability in the interacting species and their connections. Mismatch between plant and pollinator attributes can prevent interactions, while trait matching can enable exclusive access, promoting pollinators’ niche partitioning and, ultimately, modularity. Thus, plants belonging to specialized modules should integrate their ﬂoral traits to optimize the pollination function. Herein, we aimed to analyze the biological processes involved in the structuring of plant-hummingbird networks by linking network morphological constraints, specialization, modularity and phenotypic ﬂoral integration. Methods: We investigated the understory plant-hummingbird network of two adjacent habitats in the Lacandona rainforest of Mexico, one characterized by lowland rainforest and the other by savanna-like vegetation. We performed monthly censuses to record plant-hummingbird interactions for 2 years (2018–2020). We also took hummingbird bill measurements and ﬂoral and nectar measurements.",

		"abstract": "Classical ecological theory suggests that the coexistence of consumer species is fostered by resource-use differences, leading to greater resource use in communities with more species. However, explicit empirical support for this idea is lacking, because resource use by species is generally confounded with other species-specific attributes. We overcame this obstacle by co-opting behavioral plasticity in food choice among a group of animal consumers, allowing us to manipulate patterns of resource use while controlling for the effects of species identity and diversity. Within an aphid-parasitoid-radish community, we created a fully factorial manipulation of consumer resource-use breadth (specialist versus generalist) and species diversity (one versus three species) and found that resource exploitation improved with greater specialist, but not generalist, diversity. Therefore, resource partitioning, and not diversity per se, fostered greater overall resource consumption in our multispecies consumer communities.",

		"abstract": "The study of food webs has been a central theme within ecology for decades, and their structure and dynamics have been used to assess a range of key properties of communities (e.g. complexity–stability relationships) and ecosystems (e.g. fluxes of energy and nutrients). However, many food web parameters are sensitive to sampling effort, which is rarely considered, and further, most studies have used either species- or size-averaged data for both nodes and links, rather than individual-based data, which is the level of organisation at which trophic interactions occur. This practice of aggregating data hides a considerable amount of biologically meaningful variation and could, together with potential sampling effects, create methodological artefacts. New individual-based approaches could improve our understanding of, and ability to predict, food web structure and dynamics, particularly if they are derived from simple metabolic and foraging constraints. We explored the effect of species-averaging in four highly-resolved individual-based aquatic food webs (Broadstone Stream, the Afon Hirnant, Tadnoll Brook and the Celtic Sea) and found that it obscured structural regularities resulting from intraspecific size variation. The individual-based approach provided clearer insights into seasonal and ontogenetic shifts, highlighting the importance of the temporal component of size-structuring in ecological networks. An extension of the Allometric Diet Breadth Model predicted the structure of the empirical food webs almost twice as accurately as the equivalent species-based webs, with the best-fitting model predicting 83% of the links correctly in the Broadstone Stream size-based web, and the few mismatches between the model and data were explained largely by sampling effects. Our results highlight the need for theoretical explanations to correspond closely with methods of data collection and aggregation, which is the exception rather than the rule at present. We suggest how this situation can be improved by including individual-level data and more explicit information on sampling effort when constructing food webs in future studies.",

		"abstract": "Ecological thresholds are an indicator of rapid and non-linear changes along both natural habitat and land-use gradients. Thus, they can be used to quantify biodiversity responses to human-induced environmental change. We investigated multiple thresholds by analyzing eight environmental predictors of both taxonomic and functional composition of amphibian and bird communities in 47 independent sample units, located within a heterogeneous land use matrix of the megadiverse Atlantic Forest hotspot. We demonstrate that current land use practices alter both the taxonomic and functional composition and promote the establishment of non-native taxa resulting in novel assemblages. Whereas anuran communities experienced dramatic compositional shifts as a result of the transformation of closed forest habitats into Eucalyptus monocultures (at less than 10% land cover), bird communities were mainly altered through the loss of old-growth forest (at 20% forest cover loss). In both groups, observed thresholds were lower than previously reported and much lower than the 20% forest set-aside requirement defined by current land-use legislation. We argue that the strategy of halting forest loss through rapid afforestation with non-native trees has converse and potentially detrimental effects on the conservation of native forest biodiversity. Future studies need to investigate how including novel assemblages in current conservation management strategies can enhance biodiversity protection in human-impacted forest landscapes. The identification of taxon-specific thresholds for both taxonomic and functional community shifts is indispensable when formulating common land use practices and designing mitigation measures. Threshold analyses can guide these actions by providing clear and quantifiable break-points for conservation practitioners.",

In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of use, loss, and gain of Atlantic forests in the southern region of Bahia State in the last thirty-four years (1985–2019) based on pre and post-implementation of forest production policies. The area has ecological, historical, and cultural importance, and is the most conserved portion of the Atlantic Forest in northeastern Brazil. From the remote sensing products of the MapBiomas Project and spatial analyses of land use and forests, we evaluated a conflicted region that has 751 km of coastline and seventy municipalities. Our results indicate a degraded landscape, with 59% of the territory occupied by anthropogenic activities and intense fragmentation. The planting of eucalyptus forests and pasture stood out as landscape modifiers. The results show a loss of 328,595 ha of Atlantic Forest in the period under study, with a large part of this area being replaced by planted forests of Eucalyptus sp derivated the policies economics of the sector. It is urgent to consider the recovery of the Atlantic domain, prioritizing the capacity of ecosystems, especially in the Decade of Restoration.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: Plantation forests and second-growth forests are becoming dominant components of many tropical forest landscapes. Yet there is little information available concerning the consequences of different forestry options for biodiversity conservation in the tropics. We sampled the leaf-litter herpetofauna of primary, secondary, and Eucalyptus plantation forests in the Jari River area of northeastern Brazilian Amazonia. We used four complementary sampling techniques, combined samples from 2 consecutive years, and collected 1739 leaf-litter amphibians (23 species) and 1937 lizards (30 species). We analyzed the data for differences among forest types regarding patterns of alpha and beta diversity, species-abundance distributions, and community structure. Primary rainforest harbored significantly more species, but supported a similar abundance of amphibians and lizards compared with adjacent areas of second-growth forest or plantations. Plantation forests were dominated by wide-ranging habitat generalists. Secondary forest faunas contained a number of species characteristic of primary forest habitat. Amphibian communities in secondary forests and Eucalyptus plantations formed a nested subset of primary forest species, whereas the species composition of the lizard community in plantations was distinct, and was dominated by open-area species. Although plantation forests are relatively impoverished, naturally regenerating forests can help mitigate some negative effects of deforestation for herpetofauna. Nevertheless, secondary forest does not provide a substitute for primary forest, and in the absence of further evidence from older successional stands, we caution against the optimistic claim that natural forest regeneration in abandoned lands will provide refuge for the many species that are currently threatened by deforestation.",

Forests are cleared and converted to rice fields or plantations (mainly Eucalyptus or pine). How does deforestation affect the amphibian diversity of the original biotope, the rain forest? To answer this question, the amphibian fauna of intact rain forests was compared with that of secondary forests, Eucalyptus plantations and rice fields. The main consequence of rain forest disturbance was loss of amphibian species. Compared with an intact forest, species richness in secondary forests, Eucalyptus plantations and rice fields were 54%, 46% and 12%, respectively. Species number and individual density increased with increasing structural complexity of the habitat and the presence of water bodies. The reproductive strategy of the species could be decisive for the presence or absence of single species in different habitats. With increasing degradation the percentage of species spawning in water increased. Correspondingly, Hyperoliidae and Raninae were characteristic of degraded habitats, whereas Microhylidae and Mantellinae were representative of natural habitats.",

The region is covered by rainforest and plantations of banana and peach palm. From April, 2013 to March, 2014 we sampled amphibians mainly with pitfall traps with drift fences and visual and auditory surveys. A total of 9813 individuals of 36 species of anurans from nine families were recorded in this study. A larger number of species was found in forests (29 species), followed by peach palm plantations (21 species), and banana plantations (17 species). The areas of peach palm plantation and forests showed the greatest similarity in species composition. The vegetation type with the highest number of exclusive species was the forest, whereas only four species were exclusive of the peach palm plantation, and none was exclusive of the banana plantation. Species accumulation curves indicated that our sampling effort was not enough to sample all the species that occur in the region. Our results reinforce the importance of forested habitats for the maintenance of anuran diversity in the Atlantic forest. The preservation of large fragments of forest in the region of Etá Farm is necessary to preserve the diverse amphibian fauna of this region.",

		"abstract": "There is broad concern that a mass extinction of amphibians and reptiles is now underway. Here I apply an extremely conservative Bayesian method to estimate the number of recent amphibian and squamate extinctions in nine important tropical and subtropical regions. The data stem from a combination of museum collection databases and published site surveys. The method computes an extinction probability for each species by considering its sighting frequency and last sighting date. It infers hardly any extinction when collection dates are randomized and it provides underestimates when artificial extinction events are imposed. The method also appears to be insensitive to trends in sampling; therefore, the counts it provides are absolute minimums. Extinctions or severe population crashes have accumulated steadily since the 1970s and 1980s, and at least 3.1% of frog species have already disappeared. Based on these data and this conservative method, the best estimate of the global grand total is roughly 200 extinctions. Consistent with previous results, frog losses are heavy in Latin America, which has been greatly affected by the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Extinction rates are now four orders-of-magnitude higher than background, and at least another 6.9% of all frog species may be lost within the next century, even if there is no acceleration in the growth of environmental threats.",

		"abstract": "Amphibians have declined dramatically in many areas of the world. These declines seem to have worsened over the past 25 years and amphibians are now more threatened than either mammals or birds, though comparisons with other taxa are confounded by a shortage of reliable data. Research into amphibian declines has focused on: (1) documentation at the landscape or population level; and (2) observational and experimental work on potential causes of declines. Although loss of habitat is known to have impacted amphibians for decades, recent research has focused on the effects of environmental contaminants, UV-B irradiation, emerging diseases, the introduction of alien species, direct exploitation, and climate change. Such factors may interact with each other, but high levels of mortality do not necessarily lead to population declines. Major challenges remain in extrapolating from experimental data to population level effects, and in developing methodologies that will provide unbiased descriptions of amphibian population dynamics. Although amphibians have been widely advocated as good biological indicators, there is little evidence to suggest that they are more effective than other taxa as surrogate measures of biodiversity or habitat quality. As many of the threats facing amphibians are extremely difficult to neutralize in the short- to medium-term, the chances of ameliorating – let alone reversing – amphibian declines seem very poor.",

This paper investigates the diets and patterns of coexistence in this group of ecologically similar species. All thirteen species use the forest floor habitat without apparent differentiation. Most species take prey in proportions significantly different from those occurring in the leaf litter and comprise two specialist guilds: dendrobatids and bufonids that eat hard-bodied, slow-moving arthropods such as ants and mites; and leptodactylids that eat soft-bodied, mobile arthropods, primarily orthopterans and large spiders. Dendrobates femoralis (Boulenger) is a generalist, taking prey in proportions not significantly different from those in the leaf litter. Within specialist guilds, body sizes of species vary and are correlated with the size of prey taken. Foraging behavior and predator defense also correlate with the type and sizes of prey taken. Ant specialists tend to be poisonous and active searchers, taking many small prey per day. Non-ant specialists are cryptic, sit-and-wait foragers that take few large prey per day. Similarity in diet within guilds tends tobe lowest in the dry season when food is less abundant, suggesting that food is in short supply in the dry season.",

We analyzed the diet of the warty newt, alpine newt and smooth newt, living syntopically in the same pond, during all the life stages (larvae, juveniles, neotenics, adults) and throughout one entire annual cycle. Food samples were obtained by stomach‐flushing 876 newts. The newts were found to exploit a large variety of prey, mainly aquatic insects (imagoes and larvae), and other aquatic invertebrates, together with small numbers of terrestrial Arthropoda that had fallen into the pond. The dietary similarity among species and life stages was high. Although newts were able to exploit most of the range of available prey sizes, on average they selected prey size in relation to their own weight. The frequency of capture of some prey differed significantly between day and night. The six most frequent prey, equivalent to 83% of prey items, were captured with marked seasonal variations. Gastropoda, Collembola, Homoptera and Diptera were captured in relation to their cycles of availability in the pond, while the other variable prey were continuously available, and were probably exploited only when the fluctuating prey were absent. The patterns of dietary similarity among species and of seasonal and diel plasticity, indicate that newts are opportunistic and do not select specific prey taxa. Prey are selected on the basis of size, although all newts may catch a wide range of prey, with some limitations for large items. In newts, as in the other Urodela, food size is more important than type in the partitioning of feeding resources.",

The study was based on the examination of 356 individuals (154 adults, 82 juveniles and 120 froglets). A total of 26 invertebrate types were found in the diet of T. taophora. The commonest prey types in the three size classes (adults, juveniles and froglets) of rock frogs were ants, both in frequency and number. Prey composition differed significantly among size classes, except for beetles and spiders. Prey composition of males and females also differed significantly: females had a high proportion of marine isopods, caddisfly nymphs, and orthopterans in the diet, whereas males had a high proportion of ants and caterpillars. Seasonal changes in diet (all significant) in the three size classes include froglets eating more springtails and less mites in the dry season, juveniles eating more marine isopods during the wet season (similar difference for adult males), and adult females eating more ants during the wet season.",

The diet of A. debilis was numerically and volumetrically dominated by termites, followed by ants. In A. debilis, some aspects of prey size were correlated with toad head width but were not related to head length or body size (i.e., snout—vent length [SVL]). Ants were numerically the most important prey item in the diet of A. punctatus, but beetles were volumetrically the most important prey item. Prey size was not related to toad head size or body size in A. punctatus. The diet of I. mazatlanensis numerically consisted of ants, beetles, and bugs; however, volumetrically, its diet was dominated by beetles. In I. mazatlanensis, only prey length was correlated with toad head width and SVL. The diets of these 3 species generally fit our previous understanding of the diets of bufonids.",

Species of litter frogs form a continuum from species that specialize on ants and mites, through generalists, to species that avoid ants and mites. Modes of foraging and predator defense and taxa of litter frogs are correlated with position along the continuum. Atelopus and Bufo (Bufonidae) and Dendrobates (Dendrobatidae) are poisonous, searching foragers which eat many small prey, primarily ants and mites, per day. Colostethus (Dendrobatidae) eat ants, but to a lesser degree, and have a more sedentary foraging behavior than Dendrobates. Eleutherodactylus (Leptodactylidae) are cryptic, sit-and-wait foragers which eat few large prey per day, with the exception of E. vocator, which eat ants in proportion similar to Colostethus. Evidence within the Dendrobatidae suggests that specialization on ants is derived from a generalized mode of foraging. Ecological correlates of foraging mode in litter anurans are summarized and are generally similar to those in desert lizards.",

		"abstract": "Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.",

		"abstract": "We present a comprehensive approach to detect pattern in assemblages of plant and animal species linked by interactions such as pollination, frugivory or herbivory. Simple structural models produce gradient, compartmented or nested patterns of interaction; intermediate patterns between a gradient and compartments are possible, and nesting within compartments produces a combined model. Interaction patterns can be visualized and analyzed either as matrices, as bipartite networks or as multivariate sets through correspondence analysis. We argue that differences among patterns represent outcomes of distinct evolutionary and ecological processes in these highly diversified assemblages. Instead of choosing one model a priori, assemblages should be probed for a suite of patterns. A plant–pollinator assemblage exemplifies a simple nested pattern, whereas a plant–herbivore assemblage illustrates a compound pattern with nested structures within compartments. Compartmentation should reflect coevolutionary histories and constraints, whereas differences in species abundance or dispersal may generate nestedness.",

		"abstract": "Ecologists have identified several kinds of pattern in the distribution of species among sites, including a) nested subsets, b) checkerboards, c) Clementsian gradients, d) Gleasonian gradients, and e) evenly spaced gradients. Most past efforts to diagnose such patterns have focused on only one at a time, often contrasted with a sixth type of pattern, f) \"randomness\". While there are statistical tests to distinguish each of the first five patterns from randomness, there are currently no established methods for discriminating among these first five patterns in a given data set. Here we propose a method that will identify which of these possibilities is most prevalent in a site-by-species incidence matrix based on three basic aspects of meta-community structure. Our method is based on first ordinating the incidence matrix to identify the dominant axis of variation and identifying three aspects variation along this dominant axis. The first aspect, \"coherence\", is the degree to which pattern can be collapsed into a single dimension. The second, \"species turnover\", describes the number of species replacements along this dimension. The third aspect, \"boundary clumping\", has to do with how the edges of species boundaries are distributed along this dimension. We present methods for analyzing these three aspects of meta-community structure, use them to identify the six different patterns, and illustrate them with a representative set of cases drawn from previously published data.",

The causality for this common intra-archipelago pattern, however, remains elusive. Here, I present a Monte Carlo approach for investigating whether nestedness results from selective extinctions, selective immigrations, or both. Results for mammal communities of three nearshore archipelagos and two montane forest archipelagos suggested that nestedness may result from both forces. Nestedness was significantly associated with area (extinctions) for all archipelagos studied, and with isolation (immigrations) for islands of Lake Huron and the American Southwest. The degree of nestedness is influenced by the degree of variations among species and islands. In addition, our ability to assess causality of nestedness is influenced by our ability to calculate biologically relevant measures of isolation, and by the potentially confounding effects of selective immigrations and extinctions of community nestedness.",

		"abstract": "The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.",

		"abstract": "Recent attempts to examine the biological processes responsible for the general characteristics of mutualistic networks focus on two types of explanations: nonmatching biological attributes of species that prevent the occurrence of certain interactions (“forbidden links”), arising from trait complementarity in mutualist networks (as compared to barriers to exploitation in antagonistic ones), and random interactions among individuals that are proportional to their abundances in the observed community (“neutrality hypothesis”). We explored the consequences that simple linkage rules based on the first two hypotheses (complementarity of traits versus barriers to exploitation) had on the topology of plant–pollination networks. Independent of the linkage rules used, the inclusion of a small set of traits (two to four) sufficed to account for the complex topological patterns observed in real-world networks. Optimal performance was achieved by a “mixed model” that combined rules that link plants and pollinators whose trait ranges overlap (“complementarity models”) and rules that link pollinators to flowers whose traits are below a pollinator-specific barrier value (“barrier models”). Deterrence of floral parasites (barrier model) is therefore at least as important as increasing pollination efficiency (complementarity model) in the evolutionary shaping of plant–pollinator networks.",

		"abstract": "Mutualistic networks involving plants and their pollinators or frugivores have been shown recently to exhibit a particular asymmetrical organization of interactions among species called nestedness: a core of reciprocal generalists accompanied by specialist species that interact almost exclusively with generalists. This structure contrasts with compartmentalized assemblage structures that have been verified in antagonistic food webs. Here we evaluated whether nestedness is a property of another type of mutualism-the interactions between ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants-and whether species richness may lead to differences in degree of nestedness among biological communities. We investigated network structure in four communities in Mexico. Nested patterns in ant-plant networks were very similar to those previously reported for pollination and frugivore systems, indicating that this form of asymmetry in specialization is a common feature of mutualisms between free-living species, but not always present in species-poor systems. Other ecological factors also appeared to contribute to the nested asymmetry in specialization, because some assemblages showed more extreme asymmetry than others even when species richness was held constant. Our results support a promising approach for the development of multispecies coevolutionary theory, leading to the idea that specialization may coevolve in different but simple ways in antagonistic and mutualistic assemblages.",

		"abstract": "Space and time promote variation in network structure by affecting the likelihood of potential interactions. However, little is known about the relative roles of ecological and biogeographical processes in determining how species interactions vary across space and time. Here we study the spatiotemporal variation in predator–prey interaction networks formed by anurans and arthropods and test for the effects of prey availability in determining interaction patterns, information that is often absent and limits the understanding of the determinants of network structure. We found that network dissimilarity between ecoregions and seasons was high and primarily driven by interaction rewiring.We also found that species turnover was positively related to geographical distance. Using a null model approach to disentangle the effect of prey availability on the spatial and temporal variation, we show that differences in prey availability were important in determining the variation in network structure between seasons and among areas. Our study reveals that fluctuations in prey abundance, alongside the limited dispersal abilities of anurans and their prey, may be responsible for the spatial patterns that emerged in our predator–prey metaweb. These findings contribute to our understanding of the assembly rules that maintain biotic processes in metacommunities and highlight the importance of prey availability to the structure of these systems.",

We propose here a straightforward approach for quantifying nestedness using quantitative instead of presence–absence data. We named our estimator WNODF because it is a simple modification of the nestedness index called NODF. We also introduce the NODF-Program that calculates the above described nestedness metrics as well as metrics for idiosyncratic species and sites. Statistical inference is done through a null model approach, in which the user can choose among five null models commonly used for presence–absence matrices as well as three randomization algorithms for matrices that contain quantitative data. The program performs multiple analyses using many matrices. Finally, the NODF-Program provides four sorting options that, together with the null algorithms, cover a range of possibilities to test hypotheses on the possible mechanisms producing nested patterns. By using a set of model matrices, we showed that WNODF differentiates nested matrices with distinct structures and correctly identifies matrices with no nested pattern as having zero degree of nestedness.",

		"abstract": "Nestedness has been widely reported for both metacommunities and networks of interacting species. Even though the concept of this ecological pattern has been well-defined, there are several metrics by which it can be quantified. We noted that current metrics do not correctly quantify two major properties of nestedness: (1) whether marginal totals (i.e. fills) differ among columns and/or among rows, and (2) whether the presences (1's) in less-filled columns and rows coincide, respectively, with those found in the more-filled columns and rows. We propose a new metric directly based on these properties and compare its behavior with that of the most used metrics, using a set of model matrices ranging from highly-nested to alternative structures in which no nestedness should be detected. We also used an empirical dataset to explore possible biases generated by the metrics as well as to evaluate correlations between metrics. We found that nestedness has been quantified by metrics that inappropriately detect this pattern, even for matrices in which there is no nestedness. In addition, the most used metrics are prone to type I statistical errors while our new metric has better statistical properties and consistently rejects a nested pattern for different types of random matrices. The analysis of the empirical data showed that two nestedness metrics, matrix temperature and the discrepancy measure, tend to overestimate the degrees of nestedness in metacommunities. We emphasize and discuss some implications of these biases for the theoretical understanding of the processes shaping species interaction networks and metacommunity structure.",

		"abstract": "Patterns of connectance and strength of mutual dependence in mutualisms have been examined by comparing the fraction of possible pairwise interactions established in a series of plant-pollinator and plant-seed disperser systems. As the number of species in the mutualistic system increases, the absolute number of interactions established increases, but connectance decreases exponentially. A given increase in diversity adds twice the number of interactions to dispersal systems as to pollination systems, suggesting a higher global specificity of the latter. Connectance patterns in mutualisms are analogous to some of those observed in complex food webs, suggesting a somewhat invariant structure in the relations between sets of interacting species. For seed-dispersal systems involving frugivorous birds, mutual dependence values are strongly skewed toward the low end and illustrate generally strong asymmetries in mutualistic interactions. These patterns may be expected by considering simple multiplicative effects within multispecies assemblages as a result of variations in the number of species and in the underlying abundance distributions of the species involved. Coadaptation may originate from a process of species sorting without the necessity of genetic (coevolved) changes. Asymmetrical interactions and the prevalence of weak relations can provide pathways for rare species to persist and alternative routes for system responses to perturbations. These findings emphasize the diffuse nature of coevolution in mutualistic webs and suggest a mode by which diffuse coevolution can proceed.",

Coleoptera, Formicidae, and Isoptera comprised 52% of the prey types identified in the LO sample, whereas Coleoptera and insect larvae represented 58% of the prey items of LL. Frogs were not frequent in the diet of either species but, in volume, represented the second most important category for LO and the first for LL. LO showed a larger trophic niche breadth than LL. The trophic niche overlap between the two species was 68.3% for percentage of prey items. The present work confirms the relative importance of frogs in the diet of both species. The greater capacity of LL in moving far away from permanent water bodies may generate better opportunities for prey selection and a narrower trophic niche breadth. The large range of prey used by these two species indicates they are generalist/opportunistic feeders.",

An analysis of 30 food webs, using the combinatorial theory of interval graphs, suggests that a niche space of dimension 1 suffices, with unexpectedly high frequency and perhaps always, to describe the trophic niche overlaps implied by real food webs in single habitats. Consequently, real food webs fall in a small subset of the set of mathematically possible food webs.

		"abstract": "Ecological interactions shape and are shaped by the evolution of interacting species. Mathematical models and empirical work have explored the multiple ways coevolution could occur in small sets of species, revealing that the addition of even one species can change the coevolutionary dynamics of a pairwise interaction. As a consequence, one of the current challenges in evolutionary biology is to understand how species-rich assemblages evolve and coevolve as networks of interacting species. We combined an adaptive network framework, a trait evolutionary model, and data on network structure to study how network organization affects and is affected by selection in antagonistic interactions such as parasitism, predation, and herbivory. We explored how selection imposed by interactions shapes the evolution of attack and defense traits, parameterizing our models with structural information from 31 empirical assemblages of antagonistic species. In the simulations, the form of coevolution in antagonistic interactions is affected by the intensity and asymmetry of the selection imposed by the interacting partners. Transient escalation in attack and defensive traits was the most prevalent form of coevolutionary dynamics, especially in networks formed by modules of highly interacting species. Fluctuating evolution of traits was observed when the intensity of selection was higher in exploiters than in victims and was especially favored in nested networks. At the species level, highly connected species experienced higher temporal variation in selection regardless of the network structure, resulting in high trait mismatching with their partners. The mismatched patterns of highly connected species, in turn, may explain the emergence of modularity in antagonistic interactions in which selection is stronger on exploiters than on their victims. Our results highlight the roles of different aspects of network structure on antagonistic coevolution: nestedness shapes coevolutionary dynamics, whereas modularity emerges as one outcome of coevolutionary dynamics.",

		"abstract": "The erosion of functional diversity may foster the collapse of ecological systems. Functional diversity is ultimately determined by the distribution of species traits. As species traits are a legacy of species evolutionary history, one might expect that the mode of trait evolution influences community resistance under the loss of functional diversity. In this paper, we investigate the role of trait evolutionary dynamics on the robustness of mutualistic networks undergoing the following scenarios of species loss: (i) random extinctions, (ii) loss of functional distinctiveness and (iii) extinctions biased towards larger sizes. We simulated networks defined by models of single trait complementary and evolutionary modes where traits can arise in recent diversification events with weak phylogenetic signal, in early diversification events with strong phylogenetic signal, or as a random walk through evolutionary time. Our simulations show that mutualistic networks are especially vulnerable to extinctions based on trait distinctiveness and more robust to random extinction dynamics. The networks show an intermediate level of robustness against size-based extinctions. Despite the small range of variation in network robustness, our results show that the mode of trait evolution matters for network robustness in all three scenarios. Networks with low phylogenetic signal are more robust than networks with high phylogenetic signal across all scenarios. As a consequence, our results predict that mutualistic networks based upon current adaptations are more likely to cope with extinction dynamics than those networks that are based upon conserved traits.",

Location Global. Methods We briefly review existing literature and then focus on five important challenges for the further development of network-based approaches in the field. Results Our five challenges include (i) understanding cross-scale and cross-level linkages in ecological systems (top–down and bottom–up effects, such as trophic cascades, have been demonstrated in food webs but are poorly understood in nested hierarchies such as reserve networks and stream catchments), (ii) capturing dynamic aspects of ecological systems and networks (with a few exceptions we have little grasp of how important whole-network attributes change as the composition of nodes and links changes), (iii) integrating ecological aspects of network theory with metacommunity frameworks and multiple node functions and roles (can we link the spatial patterns of habitat patches in fragmented landscapes, the parallel networks of interacting species using those patches and community-level interactions as defined by metacommunity theory in a single framework?), (iv) integrating the analysis of social and ecological networks (particularly, can they be analysed as a single interacting system?) and (v) laying an empirical foundation for network analysis in conservation biogeography (this will require a larger data bank of well-studied networks from diverse habitats and systems). Main conclusions Recent research has identified a variety of approaches that we expect to contribute to progress in each of our five challenge areas. We anticipate that some of the most exciting outcomes of attempts to meet these challenges will be frameworks that unite areas of research, such as food web analysis and metacommunity theory, that have developed independently.",

We used a theoretical approach to show that the network architecture favoring stability fundamentally differs between trophic and mutualistic networks. A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks. We conclude that strong variations in the stability of architectural patterns constrain ecological networks toward different architectures, depending on the type of interaction.",

Theories of biodiversity have in the main assumed that species interact randomly with each other or have ignored inter-species interactions. Recent work, however, has shown that the interactions between species aren't a free-for-all, but are highly structured or even nested. Bastolla et al. look at the mutualistic networks between plants and animals and find that the 'nestedness' of mutualistic interactions acts to minimize competition and enhance biodiversity.

		"abstract": "Biological networks pervade nature. They describe systems throughout all levels of biological organization, from molecules regulating metabolism to species interactions that shape ecosystem dynamics. The network thinking revealed recurrent organizational patterns in complex biological systems, such as the formation of semi-independent groups of connected elements (modularity) and non-random distributions of interactions among elements. Other structural patterns, such as nestedness, have been primarily assessed in ecological networks formed by two non-overlapping sets of elements; information on its occurrence on other levels of organization is lacking. Nestedness occurs when interactions of less connected elements form proper subsets of the interactions of more connected elements. Only recently these properties began to be appreciated in one-mode networks (where all elements can interact) which describe a much wider variety of biological phenomena. Here, we compute nestedness in a diverse collection of one-mode networked systems from six different levels of biological organization depicting gene and protein interactions, complex phenotypes, animal societies, metapopulations, food webs and vertebrate metacommunities. Our findings suggest that nestedness emerge independently of interaction type or biological scale and reveal that disparate systems can share nested organization features characterized by inclusive subsets of interacting elements with decreasing connectedness. We primarily explore the implications of a nested structure for each of these studied systems, then theorize on how nested networks are assembled. We hypothesize that nestedness emerges across scales due to processes that, although system-dependent, may share a general compromise between two features: specificity (the number of interactions the elements of the system can have) and affinity (how these elements can be connected to each other). Our findings suggesting occurrence of nestedness throughout biological scales can stimulate the debate on how pervasive nestedness may be in nature, while the theoretical emergent principles can aid further research on commonalities of biological networks.",

Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant-animal mutualistic and host-parasite networks. 4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities.",

Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.",

		"abstract": "Recent work has shown that antagonist (e.g. predator–prey food web) and mutualist (e.g. pollinator–plant) network structure can be altered by global environmental change drivers, and that these alterations may have important ecosystem-level consequences. This has prompted calls for the conservation of network structure, but precisely which attributes of webs should be conserved remains unclear. Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring. Despite our growing understanding of the characteristics of food webs that confer stability and function, numerous practical challenges need to be overcome before the goal of conserving species interaction networks can be achieved.",

		"abstract": "In ecological communities, interactions between consumers and resources lead to the emergence of ecological networks and a fundamental problem to solve is to understand which factors shape network structure. Empirical and theoretical studies on ecological networks suggest predator body size is a key factor structuring patterns of interaction. Because larger predators consume a wider resource range, including the prey consumed by smaller predators, we hypothesized that variation in body size favors the rise of nestedness. In contrast, if resource consumption requires specific adaptations, predators are expected to consume distinct sets of resources, thus favoring modularity. We investigate these predictions by characterizing the trophic network of a species-rich Amazonian snake community (62 species). Our results revealed an intricate network pattern resulting from larger species feeding on higher diversity of prey and therefore promoting nestedness, whereas snakes with specific lifestyles and feeding on distinct resources, promoting modularity. Species removal simulations indicated that the nested structure is favored mainly by the presence of five species of the family Boidae, which because of their body size and generalist lifestyles connect modules in the network. Our study highlights the particular ways traits affect the structure of interactions among consumers and resources at the community level.",

		"abstract": "The structure of species interaction networks is important for species coexistence, community stability and exposure of species to extinctions. Two widespread structures in ecological networks are modularity, i.e. weakly connected subgroups of species that are internally highly interlinked, and nestedness, i.e. specialist species that interact with a subset of those species with which generalist species also interact. Modularity and nestedness are often interpreted as evolutionary ecological structures that may have relevance for community persistence and resilience against perturbations, such as climate-change. Therefore, historical climatic fluctuations could influence modularity and nestedness, but this possibility remains untested. This lack of research is in sharp contrast to the considerable efforts to disentangle the role of historical climate-change and contemporary climate on species distributions, richness and community composition patterns. Here, we use a global database of pollination networks to show that historical climate-change is at least as important as contemporary climate in shaping modularity and nestedness of pollination networks. Specifically, on the mainland we found a relatively strong negative association between Quaternary climate-change and modularity, whereas nestedness was most prominent in areas having experienced high Quaternary climate-change. On islands, Quaternary climate-change had weak effects on modularity and no effects on nestedness. Hence, for both modularity and nestedness, historical climate-change has left imprints on the network structure of mainland communities, but had comparably little effect on island communities. Our findings highlight a need to integrate historical climate fluctuations into eco-evolutionary hypotheses of network structures, such as modularity and nestedness, and then test these against empirical data. We propose that historical climate-change may have left imprints in the structural organisation of species interactions in an array of systems important for maintaining biological diversity.",

Under the neutral hypothesis, network structure would simply emerge from random encounters between individuals and thus would be directly linked to species abundance. We investigated the impact of species abundance distributions on qualitative and quantitative metrics of 113 host-parasite networks. We analyzed the concordance between neutral expectations and empirical observations at interaction, species, and network levels. We found that species abundance accurately predicts network metrics at all levels. Despite host-parasite systems being constrained by physiology and immunology, our results suggest that neutrality could also explain, at least partially, their structure.

Although several protected areas have been created in this Neotropical biome over the past decades, our knowledge of the amphibian species within these areas is still far from adequate. Here, we present lists of anuran species from three different areas of Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar: núcleos Curucutu, Santa Virgínia and São Sebastião. To survey anuran species, we visited six sampling units (two ponds, two streams and two trails inside forest fragments) in each locality. Samplings were accomplished from December 2014 to February 2015, December 2015 to February 2016 and December 2016 to February 2017, totalizing 27 days of field samplings in each sampling unit. We recorded 34 anuran species in the Núcleo Curucutu, 44 species in the Núcleo São Sebastião and 42 species in the Núcleo Santa Virgínia, totalizing 65 species belonging to 12 families (number of species in parentheses): Bufonidae (5), Brachycephalidae (6), Centrolenidae (1), Craugastoridae (1), Cycloramphidae (2), Hemiphractidae (1), Hylidae (29), Hylodidae (3), Leptodactylidae (12), Microhylidae (2), Odontophrynidae (2), and Phyllomedusidae (1). We hope that these lists can be useful for future studies as well as helping in the management and conservation planning of these protected areas.",

		"abstract": "Conservationists are far from able to assist all species under threat, if only for lack of funding. This places a premium on priorities: how can we support the most species at the least cost? One way is to identify ‘biodiversity hotspots’ where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat. As many as 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth. This opens the way for a ‘silver bullet’ strategy on the part of conservation planners, focusing on these hotspots in proportion to their share of the world's species at risk.",

		"abstract": "Although dramatic amphibian population declines have been reported worldwide, our understanding of the extent of the declines in Latin America, where amphibian diversity is high, is limited to a few well-documented studies. To better understand the geographic extent of declines, their possible causes, and the measures needed to improve Latin American scientists’ ability to research the phenomenon and make effective management recommendations, we convened three regional workshops with 88 Latin American herpetologists and conservationists. Population declines are widespread in Latin America. At least 13 countries have experienced declines, and in 40 cases species are now thought to be extinct or extirpated in a country where they once occurred. Declines or extinctions have affected 30 genera and nine families of amphibians. Most declines have occurred in remote highlands, above 500 m in elevation in Central America and above 1000 m in the Andes. Most documented declines occurred in the 1980s. Of the possible causes studied to date, climate change appears to be important at one site and chytrid fungal disease has been identified at sites in three countries. Although many monitoring studies are currently underway in a variety of habitats, most studies are recent and of short duration. In a signed resolution, workshop participants called for greater collaboration and communication among scientists working in Latin America to understand the geographic extent of population declines and the distribution of possible causal factors. In situ conservation is important to protect habitats, but captive-rearing programs for species subject to imminent extinction are also needed. Better understanding of the taxonomy and natural history of amphibians and more funding for research and monitoring are critical to developing a scientific basis for management action to arrest and reverse population declines.",

We present a global, quantitative assessment of the amphibian chytridiomycosis panzootic, one of the most impactful examples of disease spread, and demonstrate its role in the decline of at least 501 amphibian species over the past half-century, including 90 presumed extinctions. The effects of chytridiomycosis have been greatest in large-bodied, range-restricted anurans in wet climates in the Americas and Australia. Declines peaked in the 1980s, and only 12% of declined species show signs of recovery, whereas 39% are experiencing ongoing decline. There is risk of further chytridiomycosis outbreaks in new areas. The chytridiomycosis panzootic represents the greatest recorded loss of biodiversity attributable to a disease.",

Despite the abundance and diversity of these animals, many aspects of the biology of amphibians remain unstudied or misunderstood. The Ecology and Behavior of Amphibians aims to fill this gap in the literature on this remarkable taxon. It is a celebration of the diversity of amphibian life and the ecological and behavioral adaptations that have made it a successful component of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Synthesizing seventy years of research on amphibian biology, Kentwood D. Wells addresses all major areas of inquiry, including phylogeny, classification, and morphology; aspects of physiological ecology such as water and temperature relations, respiration, metabolism, and energetics; movements and orientation; communication and social behavior; reproduction and parental care; ecology and behavior of amphibian larvae and ecological aspects of metamorphosis; ecological impact of predation on amphibian populations and antipredator defenses; and aspects of amphibian community ecology. With an eye towards modern concerns, The Ecology and Behavior of Amphibians concludes with a chapter devoted to amphibian conservation. An unprecedented scholarly contribution to amphibian biology, this book is eagerly anticipated among specialists.",

		"abstract": "Resource partitioning, or differences in how species use resources, has been studied in a wide variety of amphibians and reptiles, and causes for resource-partitioning patterns are now understood in several well-documented cases. This study, a review of these papers, reveals a common theme: Resource-partitioning patterns result from three categories of causes, of which competition is just one; the other two are predation and factors that operate independently of interspecific interactions, such as physiological constraints. Moreover, in each of the case histories presented below, we find two or more mechanisms interacting in complex ways. In no case does a single factor, for example competition, ever act alone. These case histories therefore provide an admonishment to single-minded tests of community-wide patterns that pit competition against everything (or nothing) else. Rather, a variety of factors may cause community-wide patterns such as resource partitioning, and the relative importance of these factors may differ among taxa and among communities at different geographic locations.",

Along streams draining hilly rain forest in Sarawak and having widths of 10-70 ft (3-21 m), we find an assemblage of roughly twenty-five species of frogs either restricted to the riparian habitat for all postmetamorphic functions or tied to streams for breeding activities. 2. Nine species dominate the communities in the four streams having widths in excess of 20 ft (6 m). These nine species may be grouped into four main ecological types: large, strictly terrestrial, weakly clustered, riparian species; small to large, partially arboreal, weakly clustered, riparian species; small, partially arboreal, strongly clustered, riparian species; and one large, mainly arboreal, strongly clustered species that is not restricted to stream banks. 3. Phylogenetically related species tend to be associated in the same ecological types which leads to the conclusion that historical factors have been more important than contemporary ecological forces in the niche distribution of these species. 4. Equitability values based on the collections of the six study streams show little variation, which suggests similarity in community organization. Closer inspection of the relative abundances of ecological types on the several streams reveals a basic difference between the two smaller streams and the other four. Equitability values, therefore, provide a refined measure of similarity in community structure in detail only if examination of ecological types and their relative proportions indicates rough similarity at a coarse scale.",

		"abstract": "Larger predators consume prey of greater mean size and include a wider diversity of prey in their diets than their smaller counterparts occurring in the same communities. There is some controversy as to whether these patterns result from opportunistic feeding behavior or from prey size selectivity leading to food-niche segregation among predators. This study examined the effects of body size on the diet of avian predators in the sagebrush habitat of north-eastern Utah. The assessment was based on data collected from the analysis of pellet contents and was deliberately confined to mammalian components, almost exclusively from rodents. A significant positive relationship was found between predator size and both average and maximum prey size, but no such correlation was found for the minimum body size of prey. In general, there was considerable overlap in the rodent prey taken by different raptors, suggesting opportunistic feeding behavior in these predators. However, the size (and species) of rodent prey that contributed most to the consumed biomass was different for each bird species and correlated well with its body size. The revealed pattern of larger raptors acquiring most biomass (energy) from larger prey, implies food selectivity based on its energetic profitability, and niche segregation that could facilitate the coexistence of a high diversity of avian predators in the sagebrush habitat. The possible role of food limitation and competition in the evolution of body size in raptors and the consequences of size-dependent predation are discussed.",

		"abstract": "A long-standing question in community ecology is whether food webs are organized in compartments, where species within the same compartment interact frequently among themselves, but show fewer interactions with species from other compartments. Finding evidence for this community organization is important since compartmentalization may strongly affect food web robustness to perturbation. However, few studies have found unequivocal evidence of compartments, and none has quantified the suite of mechanisms generating such a structure. Here, we combine computational tools from the physics of complex networks with phylogenetic statistical methods to show that a large marine food web is organized in compartments, and that body size, phylogeny, and spatial structure are jointly associated with such a compartmentalized structure. Sharks account for the majority of predatory interactions within their compartments. Phylogenetically closely related shark species tend to occupy different compartments and have divergent trophic levels, suggesting that competition may play an important role structuring some of these compartments. Current overfishing of sharks has the potential to change the structural properties, which might eventually affect the stability of the food web.",

		"abstract": "1 Size relationships are central in structuring trophic linkages within food webs, leading to suggestions that the dietary niche of smaller carnivores is nested within that of larger species. However, past analyses have not taken into account the differing selection shown by carnivores for specific size ranges of prey, nor the extent to which the greater carcass mass of larger prey outweighs the greater numerical representation of smaller prey species in the predator diet. Furthermore, the top-down impact that predation has on prey abundance cannot be assessed simply in terms of the number of predator species involved. 2 Records of found carcasses and cause of death assembled over 46 years in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, corrected for under-recording of smaller species, enabled a definitive assessment of size relationships between large mammalian carnivores and their ungulate prey. Five carnivore species were considered, including lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and 22 herbivore prey species larger than 10 kg in adult body mass. 3 These carnivores selectively favoured prey species approximately half to twice their mass, within a total prey size range from an order of magnitude below to an order of magnitude above the body mass of the predator. The three smallest carnivores, i.e. leopard, cheetah and wild dog, showed high similarity in prey species favoured. Despite overlap in prey size range, each carnivore showed a distinct dietary preference. 4 Almost all mortality was through the agency of a predator for ungulate species up to the size of a giraffe (800–1200 kg). Ungulates larger than twice the mass of the predator contributed substantially to the dietary intake of lions, despite the low proportional mortality inflicted by predation on these species. Only for megaherbivores substantially exceeding 1000 kg in adult body mass did predation become a negligible cause of mortality. 5 Hence, the relative size of predators and prey had a pervasive structuring influence on biomass fluxes within this large-mammal food web. Nevertheless, the large carnivore assemblage was dominated overwhelmingly by the largest predator, which contributed the major share of animals killed across a wide size range.",

		"abstract": "It has been suggested by Cohen and Newman (1985) that many of the patterns in published food webs can be derived from a stochastic model in which the species are arranged in a trophic hierarchy (the ‘cascade model’). We suggest that, if predators are larger than their prey, a trophic hierarchy can be generated on the basis of body size Empirical evidence from the literature shows that there is a positive relationship between predator and prey size for a range of invertebrates and that predators are usually larger than their prey. Using experimental data on an aquatic food web we show that body size can lead to the type of trophic hierarchy used in the cascade model, suggesting that many food web patterns may be a product of body size. This conclusion is discussed with respect to the limitations of the food web data and the relationship between ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ models of web structure.",

		"abstract": "It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.",

		"abstract": "Understanding what structures ecological communities is vital to answering questions about extinctions, environmental change, trophic cascades, and ecosystem functioning. Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65% of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction. The model results support the hypothesis that individual behavior, subject to natural selection, determines individual diets and that food web structure is the sum of these individual decisions.",

We used weighted networks to analyze the resource use by sea otters, testing three alternative models for how individual diet specialisation may arise. As expected, individual specialisation was absent when otter density was low, but increased at high-otter density. A high-density emergence of nested resource-use networks was consistent with the model assuming individuals share preference ranks. However, a density-dependent emergence of a nonnested modular network for ÔcoreÕ resources was more consistent with the Ôcompetitive refugeÕ model. Individuals from different diet modules showed predictable variation in rank-order prey preferences and handling times of core resources, further supporting the competitive refuge model. Our ﬁndings support a hierarchical organisation of diet specialisation and suggest individual use of core and marginal resources may be driven by different selective pressures.",

In Florida, where the species was introduced via the pet trade and is invasive, there are at least 3 established populations as well as numerous one-off observations. We collected ABWTs from public and private property to determine their diet in central Florida (Hillsborough County) from 2012 to 2016. We determined frequency of occurrence (FO) for items identified to various taxonomic levels, calculated niche overlap to check for an ontogenetic shift in diet, and evaluated seasonal variation in diet. Stomach contents revealed ABWTs (n = 93) in central Florida consume fruit, invertebrates, and vertebrates, including hatchling Gopherus polyphemus (Gopher Tortoise). Frequency of occurrence of food items varied seasonally. Vertebrate prey was most common in the spring, whereas invertebrates and plants were consumed most frequently in summer. Diets among ABWTs were very similar, as indicated by Pianka's measure of niche overlap, regardless of age or sex. A greater proportion of ABWTs in central Florida consumed vertebrates compared to other invasive and native populations (FOcentralFL = 81%, FOsouthernFL= 37%, FOBrazil = 27%, FOArgentina = 44%). Argentice Black and White Tegus in central Florida are generalist omnivores and consume a diversity of taxa across several trophic levels, including imperiled species.",

The potential impacts of this species on native Florida wildlife are not yet known. This study looks at the stomach contents of 169 S. merianae captured between 2011 and 2013 in south Florida to infer potential impacts of S. merianae and spatial or seasonal shifts in diet. Analysis of 169 GI tracts showed that S. merianae is an omnivorous, terrestrial forager with a broad dietary range which includes insects, fruits, plants, snails, crayfish, carrion, birds, small mammals, turtles, snakes, lizards, frogs and eggs. S. merianae diet composition varied with capture habitat, the fattest tegus were collected from disturbed/agricultural areas and these samples contained, primarily, gastropods and insects. Tegu dietary habits threaten local endangered and state listed species such as the American crocodile, Crocodylus acutus, and the Cape Sable seaside sparrow, Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis. Dedicated funds and efforts need to be focused on this species to limit its further spread and future impact on native species.",

		"abstract": "Top predators have often been persecuted because of their supposed negative effects on species of economic concern on which they feed. In some cases, however, they may actually benefit their prey through intraguild predation on other smaller predators that share the prey. In each of two representative situations, in one of which lynx were present and in the other absent, we (1) estimated gross number of rabbits taken by lynx and Egyptian mongooses (smaller predators that are themselves preyed upon by lynx; (2) simulated size-structured rabbit populations of different densities, taking into account the reproductive value of the individuals taken by predators; and (3) estimated actual rabbit densities. Numbers of rabbits taken by predators during a year were found to be between 4.8 and 9.5 times greater when lynx were not present. After a year, rabbit population growth for an initial rabbit density of 15/ha was between 12% and 22% lower when lynx were not present. For lower initial rabbit densities, the positive effect of lynx presence on rabbits was greater. Actual rabbit densities in the areas used by lynx were 2–4 times higher than in areas not used by lynx, even though these areas were similar or identical in habitat composition. These results support the suggestion that removal of top predators may sometimes have a negative effect on prey populations of human economic concern.",

		"abstract": "Snakes and lizards (Squamata) represent a third of terrestrial vertebrates and exhibit spectacular innovations in locomotion, feeding, and sensory processing. However, the evolutionary drivers of this radiation remain poorly known. We infer potential causes and ultimate consequences of squamate macroevolution by combining individual-based natural history observations (>60,000 animals) with a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny that we anchored with genomic data (5400 loci) from 1018 species. Due to shifts in the dynamics of speciation and phenotypic evolution, snakes have transformed the trophic structure of animal communities through the recurrent origin and diversification of specialized predatory strategies. Squamate biodiversity reflects a legacy of singular events that occurred during the early history of snakes and reveals the impact of historical contingency on vertebrate biodiversity.",

Recently, the species has been introduced in the USA, in the southern states of Florida and Georgia. It is found throughout most of Brazil, inhabiting natural environments, such as open areas, clearings and forest edges, as well as urban areas. Salvator merianae is one of the largest Neotropical lizards, reaching up to 1.6 m in length and weighing up to 5 kg, which makes it an attractive food source for humans in many regions. It is an active generalist and omnivore, consuming a wide variety of invertebrates and vertebrates, carcasses, eggs, mushrooms, and plants. Despite the diverse known food items in the diet of this species, records of new prey species are still being reported, indicating the existence of knowledge gaps about its diet. Here, we i) report a predation on a new snake species of the genus Dipsas (Squamata: Dipsadidae) by S. merianae in the Atlantic Forest from the southeastern region of Minas Gerais State, and ii) perform a much-needed literature review on the diet of this species, which data are so far scattered throughout the literature.",

MODULAR reads a set of files representing unipartite or bipartite networks, and identifies modules using two different modularity metrics widely used in the ecological networks literature. To estimate modularity, the software offers five optimization methods to the user. The software also includes two null models commonly used in studies of ecological networks to verify how the degree of modularity differs from two distinct theoretical benchmarks.",

		"abstract": "Studies of functional diversity (FD) have gained immense interest because they promise a more mechanistic understanding of the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning. However, the concept of FD is currently not used to its full potential because of several biases and shortcomings. For instance, while the analysis of traits related to species’ Grinnellian niches, i.e. traits influencing species’ fitness under different environmental conditions, is well-advanced, there is a lack of studies on the functional diversity related to species’ Eltonian niches, i.e. species’ functional roles in ecological processes and their effects on other species, a discrepancy known as the Eltonian Shortfall. Most importantly, the current indirect approach of measuring FD via species traits restricts analyses to species with similar traits, usually a taxon. Consequently, FD is generally measured for only one taxon but across different ecological processes, when it would ideally be measured for one ecological process but across all taxa that contribute to that process. These discrepancies hinder advances of our understanding of the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions and services. We introduce a new approach to measuring functional diversity that is designed to overcome these shortcomings by bridging research on networks, species niches, and functional traits. Instead of characterizing functional roles indirectly via species’ traits, we propose to characterize functional roles directly via the traits of species’ resources and interaction partners in a given ecological process. Critically, this shift in perspective for the first time allows comparisons of the functional roles of all taxa that participate in an ecological process regardless of their own morphology. We illustrate our new approach with a study on functional roles of frugivores in seed-dispersal systems. Our approach is an important addition to existing approaches to studying FD, and it facilitates new studies in a vastly unexplored field of functional diversity research.",

		"abstract": "Food webs, the networks of feeding links between species, are central to our understanding of ecosystem structure, stability, and function. One of the key aspects of food web structure is complexity, or connectance, the number of links expressed as a proportion of the total possible number of links. Connectance (complexity) is linked to the stability of webs and is a key parameter in recent models of other aspects of web structure. However, there is still no fundamental biological explanation for connectance in food webs. Here, we propose that constraints on diet breadth, driven by optimal foraging, provide such an explanation. We show that a simple diet breadth model predicts highly constrained values of connectance as an emergent consequence of individual foraging behavior. When combined with features of real food web data, such as taxonomic and trophic aggregation and cumulative sampling of diets, the model predicts well the levels of connectance and scaling of connectance with species richness, seen in real food webs. This result is a previously undescribed synthesis of foraging theory and food web theory, in which network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals and, as such, provides a mechanistic explanation of connectance currently lacking in food web models.",

		"abstract": "Variation in species richness across environmental gradients may be associated with an expanded volume or increased packing of ecological niche space. However, the relative importance of these alternative scenarios remains unknown, largely because standardized information on functional traits and their ecological relevance is lacking for major diversity gradients. Here, we combine data on morphological and ecological traits for 523 species of passerine birds distributed across an Andes-to-Amazon elevation gradient. We show that morphological traits capture substantial variation in species dietary (75%) and foraging niches (60%) when multiple independent trait dimensions are considered. Having established these relationships, we show that the 14-fold increase in species richness towards the lowlands is associated with both an increased volume and density of functional trait space. However, we find that increases in volume contribute little to changes in richness, with most (78%) lowland species occurring within the range of trait space occupied at high elevations. Taken together, our results suggest that high species richness is mainly associated with a denser occupation of functional trait space, implying an increased specialization or overlap of ecological niches, and supporting the view that niche packing is the dominant trend underlying gradients of increasing biodiversity towards the lowland tropics.",

		"abstract": "That evolutionary history can influence the way that species interact is a basic tenet of evolutionary ecology. However, when the role of evolution in determining ecological interactions is investigated, focus typically centers on just one side of the interaction. A cophylogenetic signal, the congruence of evolutionary history across both sides of an ecological interaction, extends these previous explorations and provides a more complete picture of how evolutionary patterns influence the way species interact. To date, cophylogenetic signal has most typically been studied in interactions that occur between fine taxonomic clades that show high intimacy. In this study, we took an alternative approach and made an exhaustive assessment of cophylogeny in pollination interactions. To do so, we assessed the strength of cophylogenetic signal at four distinct scales of pollination interaction: (1) across plant–pollinator associations globally, (2) in local pollination communities, (3) within the modular structure of those communities, and (4) in individual modules. We did so using a globally distributed dataset comprised of 54 pollination networks, over 4000 species, and over 12,000 interactions. Within these data, we detected cophylogenetic signal at all four scales. Cophylogenetic signal was found at the level of plant–pollinator interactions on a global scale and in the majority of pollination communities. At the scale defined by the modular structure within those communities, however, we observed a much weaker cophylogenetic signal. Cophylogenetic signal was detectable in a significant proportion of individual modules and most typically when within-module phylogenetic diversity was low. In sum, the detection of cophylogenetic signal in pollination interactions across scales provides a new dimension to the story of how past evolution shapes extant pollinator–angiosperm interactions.",

		"abstract": "Extreme weather events perturb ecosystems and increasingly threaten biodiversity1. Ecologists emphasize the need to forecast and mitigate the impacts of these events, which requires knowledge of how risk is distributed among species and environments. However, the scale and unpredictability of extreme events complicate risk assessment1–4—especially for large animals (megafauna), which are ecologically important and disproportionately threatened but are wide-ranging and difficult to monitor5. Traits such as body size, dispersal ability and habitat affiliation are hypothesized to determine the vulnerability of animals to natural hazards1,6,7. Yet it has rarely been possible to test these hypotheses or, more generally, to link the short-term and long-term ecological effects of weather-related disturbance8,9. Here we show how large herbivores and carnivores in Mozambique responded to Intense Tropical Cyclone Idai, the deadliest storm on record in Africa, across scales ranging from individual decisions in the hours after landfall to changes in community composition nearly 2 years later. Animals responded behaviourally to rising floodwaters by moving upslope and shifting their diets. Body size and habitat association independently predicted population-level impacts: five of the smallest and most lowland-affiliated herbivore species declined by an average of 28% in the 20 months after landfall, while four of the largest and most upland-affiliated species increased by an average of 26%. We attribute the sensitivity of small-bodied species to their limited mobility and physiological constraints, which restricted their ability to avoid the flood and endure subsequent reductions in the quantity and quality of food. Our results identify general traits that govern animal responses to severe weather, which may help to inform wildlife conservation in a volatile climate.",

		"abstract": "Ecological communities are dynamic entities subjected to extinction/colonization events. Because species are connected through complex interaction networks, the arrival of a new species is likely to affect various species across the community, as observed in plant biological invasions. However, plant invasions usually represent extreme scenarios in which the community is strongly dominated by the alien species, confounding the effects of a change in species composition with a massive increase in floral resource availability. Our study addresses changes in plant community composition involving native species, a common phenomenon under the current climate change scenario in which plants are modifying their distribution ranges. We experimentally manipulated patches of a natural scrubland community by introducing a native plant (henceforth colonizing plant). To avoid introducing a disproportionate amount of floral resources we adjusted the number of flowers of the colonizing plant to the amount of floral resources locally available in each patch. We had two objectives: (1) to analyse the effects of the arrival of a new plant on the pollinator community, the rearrangement of plant–pollinator interactions and the structure of the plant–pollinator network; (2) to evaluate potential consequences for pollination and the reproductive success of resident plant species. The colonizing plant acted as a magnet species, attracting bumble bees and facilitating interactions to other plants through spill-over. The introduction of the colonizing plant also affected the structure of plant–pollinator networks (colonized networks were more generalized and more nested than control networks) and modified the arrangement of plant and pollinator species into modules. Ultimately, these changes resulted in higher heterospecific (but not conspecific) pollen deposition and had contrasting effects on the reproductive success of two resident plant species (higher fruit set and lower seed set, respectively). Our study shows that relationships between plants and pollinators are rapidly rearranged in response to novel situations (even when the new plant is not overly dominant), with important functional consequences on pollination and plant reproductive success. Our study establishes a link between network structure and pollination and plant reproductive success, which may be mediated by differences among pollinator species in foraging behavior.",

		"abstract": "Current theory predicts a distinct upper limit on the permissible degree of niche overlap; moreover, theory suggests that maximal tolerable overlap should be relatively insensitive to environmental variability. Data presented here demonstrate that, within the lizard subset of natural desert communities, niche overlap decreases both with increasing environmental variability and with increasing numbers of lizard species. The latter two factors are themselves positively correlated. A partial correlation analysis is interpreted as indicating that the extent of tolerable niche overlap does not necessarily decrease due to environmental variability, but rather that overlap is probably more closely related to the number of potential interspecific competitors in a community, or what has been termed “diffuse competition.” This result lends support to the “niche overlap hypothesis,” which asserts that maximal tolerable overlap should vary inversely with the intensity of competition. Moreover, this empirical discovery indicates that niche overlap theory could be profitably expanded to incorporate the number of competing species. Although the average amount of overlap between pairs of species decreases with the intensity of diffuse competition, the overall degree of competitive inhibition tolerated by individuals comprising an average species could nevertheless remain relatively constant, provided that extensive niche overlap with a few competitors is roughly equivalent to lower average overlap with a greater number of competitors.",

		"abstract": "Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1546–1559 Abstract Species coexistence within ecosystems and the stability of patterns of temporal changes in population sizes are central topics in ecological theory. In the last decade, adaptive behaviour has been proposed as a mechanism of population stabilization. In particular, widely distributed adaptive trophic behaviour (ATB), the fitness-enhancing changes in individuals’ feeding-related traits due to variation in their trophic environment, may play a key role in modulating the dynamics of feeding relationships within natural communities. In this article, we review and synthesize models and results from theoretical research dealing with the consequences of ATB on the structure and dynamics of complex food webs. We discuss current approaches, point out limitations, and consider questions ripe for future research. In spite of some differences in the modelling and analytic approaches, there are points of convergence: (1) ATB promotes the complex structure of ecological networks, (2) ATB increases the stability of their dynamics, (3) ATB reverses May’s negative complexity–stability relationship, and (4) ATB provides resilience and resistance of networks against perturbations. Current knowledge supports ATB as an essential ingredient for models of community dynamics, and future research that incorporates ATB will be well positioned to address questions important for basic ecological research and its applications.",

		"abstract": "Nestedness has been widely reported for both metacommunities and networks of interacting species. Even though the concept of this ecological pattern has been well-defined, there are several metrics by which it can be quantified. We noted that current metrics do not correctly quantify two major properties of nestedness: (1) whether marginal totals (i.e. fills) differ among columns and/or among rows, and (2) whether the presences (1's) in less-filled columns and rows coincide, respectively, with those found in the more-filled columns and rows. We propose a new metric directly based on these properties and compare its behavior with that of the most used metrics, using a set of model matrices ranging from highly-nested to alternative structures in which no nestedness should be detected. We also used an empirical dataset to explore possible biases generated by the metrics as well as to evaluate correlations between metrics. We found that nestedness has been quantified by metrics that inappropriately detect this pattern, even for matrices in which there is no nestedness. In addition, the most used metrics are prone to type I statistical errors while our new metric has better statistical properties and consistently rejects a nested pattern for different types of random matrices. The analysis of the empirical data showed that two nestedness metrics, matrix temperature and the discrepancy measure, tend to overestimate the degrees of nestedness in metacommunities. We emphasize and discuss some implications of these biases for the theoretical understanding of the processes shaping species interaction networks and metacommunity structure.",

		"abstract": "Diet composition is among the most important yet least understood dimensions of animal ecology. Inspired by the study of species abundance distributions (SADs), we tested for generalities in the structure of vertebrate diets by characterising them as dietary abundance distributions (DADs). We compiled data on 1167 population-level diets, representing >500 species from six vertebrate classes, spanning all continents and oceans. DADs near-universally (92.5%) followed a hollow-curve shape, with scant support for other plausible rank-abundance-distribution shapes. This strong generality is inherently related to, yet incompletely explained by, the SADs of available food taxa. By quantifying dietary generalisation as the half-saturation point of the cumulative distribution of dietary abundance (sp50, minimum number of foods required to account for 50% of diet), we found that vertebrate populations are surprisingly specialised: in most populations, fewer than three foods accounted for at least half the diet. Variation in sp50 was strongly associated with consumer type, with carnivores being more specialised than herbivores or omnivores. Other methodological (sampling method and effort, taxonomic resolution), biological (body mass, frugivory) and biogeographic (latitude) factors influenced sp50 to varying degrees. Future challenges include identifying the mechanisms underpinning the hollow-curve DAD, its generality beyond vertebrates, and the biological determinants of dietary generalisation.",

		"abstract": "The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) or coney is a species of rabbit native to the Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal and Andorra), western France, and the northern Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa. It has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. Its decline in its native range due to myxomatosis, rabbit hemorrhagic disease, overhunting and habitat loss has caused the decline of the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) and Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti). It is known as an invasive species because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and has caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems; in particular, European rabbits in Australia have had a devastating impact, due in part to the lack of natural predators there.\nThe European rabbit is well known for digging networks of burrows, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related hares (Lepus spp.), rabbits are altricial, the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mothers. Much of the modern research into wild rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres. One was the naturalist Ronald Lockley, who maintained a number of large enclosures for wild rabbit colonies, with observation facilities, in Orielton, Pembrokeshire. Apart from publishing a number of scientific papers, he popularised his findings in a book The Private Life of the Rabbit, which is credited by Richard Adams as having played a key role in his gaining \"a knowledge of rabbits and their ways\" that informed his novel Watership Down. The other group was the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, where numerous studies of the social behavior of wild rabbits were performed. Since the onset of myxomatosis, and the decline of the significance of the rabbit as an agricultural pest, few large-scale studies have been performed and many aspects of rabbit behaviour are still poorly understood.",

Rail populations are notoriously hard to survey and the rugged topography of Inaccessible Island makes a survey particularly challenging. Fortunately, Inaccessible Island Rails are very vocal, because their secretive behaviour means birds are hard to observe in the dense vegetation. We assessed the distribution of rails across Inaccessible Island using playbacks at 350 point-count sites in October–November 2018. Rail calls were heard at 98% of sites and we estimate the rail population to be in the order of 10,300 birds (95% CI 9,100–12,200), based on estimated rail densities in the six main habitats. Historic population estimates were reasonably crude and thus not suitable for inferring population trends, but the population appears to be stable and we recommend the species’ status remains as ‘Vulnerable’. The accidental introduction of alien mammals poses the greatest threat to the survival of the Inaccessible Island Rail and the removal of house mouse Mus musculus and ship rat Rattus rattus from neighbouring Tristan da Cunha Island would greatly reduce the risk of such a catastrophe.",

		"abstract": "1 European rabbits are considered a keystone species in the Iberian Peninsula. Their populations have sharply declined over the past century, mainly due to habitat loss and the arrival of two viral diseases: myxomatosis in the 1950s and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) at the end of the 1980s. For the conservation of the Iberian Mediterranean ecosystem, it is important to determine whether rabbit populations are recovering two decades after the RHD outbreak, and to identify the factors associated with population recovery. 2 Here, we review the current knowledge on recent rabbit population trends in the Iberian Peninsula and the factors associated with these trends. 3 Although most rabbit populations are still declining in the Iberian Peninsula, a few seem to have recovered. In general, positive trends have been recorded in species-friendly habitats characterized by non-fragmented landscapes, interspersed patches of Mediterranean scrubland, good pastures and/or crops, soft soils that are suitable for warren construction and a Mediterranean climate with relatively high rainfall. Additionally, rabbits seem to be recovering better in areas where management practices (e.g. low hunting pressure, habitat management and predator control) are applied to increase their numbers. 4 From these findings, it is possible to identify five broad objectives for rabbit conservation in the Iberian Peninsula. First, it is clearly necessary to establish a long-term programme for monitoring rabbit abundance and trends on a large scale. Second, the conservation and restoration of open Mediterranean scrubland should be a priority for stabilizing and maintaining existing healthy rabbit populations. Third, despite the lack of experimental evidence, management activities aimed at increasing the quantity and quality of both refuge and food should continue to be implemented. Fourth, legislation on the timing of the hunting season should be revisited following recommendations made by scientists. Finally, experimental approaches are required to investigate whether the control of generalist predators is a successful strategy to allow rabbit populations to recover.",

		"abstract": "Factors influencing the growth and mortality patterns of young were examined in a small population of European wild rabbits. Juveniles were trapped and tagged for individual identification soon after their emergence from underground nests. Age was estimated from weight on first capture and survivorship determined from the last date individuals were observed. Differences in growth rates of young born throughout the season and between the three years of the study were related to population density. Maternal social status had no significant effect on post-emergence growth rates of kittens, or on offspring survival. Young born in females' first litters of the season, in March, had significantly lower mortality than subsequent litters. Cats and stoats were regularly observed on the study site and are likely to have been major agents of juvenile mortality. There was no difference in the growth rates of the sexes, and correspondingly non-breeding adult males and females were of similar body weight. From their first days above ground juvenile males suffered significantly higher mortality than females. Differential mortality may be linked to previously reported sex differences in behaviour if the greater activity of young males made them more vulnerable to predation or attack by neighbouring territorial conspecifics.",

		"abstract": "Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category–subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods – both sample-based and individual-based – allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.",

Standard procedures included enumeration of food items, volumetric analysis, and measure of frequency of occurrence. The authors identified the majority of forage organisms to the specific level through usual taxonomic methods for whole animals. Identification of partially digested animals was accomplished through the use of otoliths for fish, beaks for cephalopods, and the exoskeleton for invertebrates. A pictorial guide to beaks of certain eastern Pacific cephalopods was prepared and proved helpful in identifying stomach contents. This guide is presented in this publication. The study indicates the prominent forage for bluefin tuna, bonito, and albacore in California waters is the northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax.",

		"abstract": "Em comunidades ecologicas, especies sao conectadas por interacoes. Interacoes ecologicas formam redes e a organizacao dessas redes pode ter importantes implicacoes para conservacao, afetando potencialmente a robustez dos sistemas ecologicos a perda de especies. Neste contexto, e essencial compreender a estrutura das interacoes ecologicas ao nivel da comunidade, e como essas interacoes influenciam os papeis desempenhados pelas diferentes especies. A fim de compreender como as redes de interacoes moldam as comunidades, a abordagem de redes fornece um conjunto de ferramentas para visualizar e descrever sistemas ecologicos inteiros. Um dos sistemas ecologicos mais amplamente estudados sao as redes de interacoes troficas. Utilizando serpentes como modelo de estudo, esta tese teve por objetivo compreender como redes de interacoes troficas moldam a estrutura de comunidades serpentes-presas. No primeiro capitulo, nos investigamos a estrutura da rede trofica de uma comunidade rica e bem estudada de serpentes amazonicas. Nossos resultados revelaram que a estrutura da rede e parcialmente resultante do fato de especies de maior tamanho se alimentarem de maior diversidade de presas e, portanto, promovendo estrutura aninhada, enquanto que serpentes com estilos de vida especificos e se alimentando de recursos distintos, promoveram modularidade. Simulacoes de remocao de especies indicaram que a estrutura aninhada foi favorecida principalmente pela presenca de cinco especies da familia Boidae (familia de grandes serpentes constritoras), que devido ao seu tamanho corporal e estilos de vida generalistas conectaram modulos formados por outras serpentes e recursos na rede. No segundo capitulo, nos caracterizamos 24 redes serpentes-presas, amplamente distribuidas. Estudamos a associacao entre latitude, atributos da comunidade (riqueza, diversidade taxonomica e variacao de tamanho corporal entre serpentes) e estrutura de rede. Tambem avaliamos a importancia diferencial dos recursos alimentares na dieta das serpentes. Nossos resultados mostraram que a estrutura das redes foi em geral aninhada, moderadamente conectada e nao modular. A latitude influenciou apenas a variacao de tamanho entre as serpentes, que juntamente com a riqueza, influenciaram apenas o aninhamento. Tambem observamos que redes de regioes tropicais foram mais aninhadas do que as de regioes temperadas. A analise da centralidade dos recursos indicou que anfibios, lagartos ou pequenos mamiferos representam os recursos centrais na dieta das serpentes ao longo das multiplas redes. Por fim, no terceiro capitulo, nos investigamos como diferentes atributos biologicos (tamanho do corpo, estilo de vida e historia filogenetica) podem revelar a importancia das serpentes em 23 redes serpentes-presa. Utilizando metricas de centralidade e analises de efeitos indiretos, nossos resultados indicaram que, em geral, maiores tamanhos corporais, estilos de vida aquaticos e semi-arboreos e linhagens das grandes serpentes constritoras, apresentaram maior associacao com as centralidades do grau e por intermedio, que tambem foram as metricas que mais contribuiram para a transmissao dos efeitos indiretos nas redes. Ao integrar analises de redes de interacoes com dados de historia natural, historia evolutiva das linhagens, atributos das comunidades e atributos biologicos das especies, foi possivel compreender, nesta tese, como as comunidades de serpentes estao estruturadas com base no uso dos recursos alimentares e quais atributos biologicos fazem de uma serpente uma especie-chave dentro da comunidade.",

This new edition of the bestselling Randomization, Bootstrap and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology illustrates the value of a number of these methods with an emphasis on biological applications. This textbook focuses on three related areas in computational statistics: randomization, bootstrapping, and Monte Carlo methods of inference. The author emphasizes the sampling approach within randomization testing and confidence intervals. Similar to randomization, the book shows how bootstrapping, or resampling, can be used for confidence intervals and tests of significance. It also explores how to use Monte Carlo methods to test hypotheses and construct confidence intervals.New to the Third EditionUpdated information on regression and time series analysis, multivariate methods, survival and growth data as well as software for computational statisticsReferences that reflect recent developments in methodology and computing techniquesAdditional references on new applications of computer-intensive methods in biologyProviding comprehensive coverage of computer-intensive applications while also offering data sets online, Randomization, Bootstrap and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology, Third Edition supplies a solid foundation for the ever-expanding field of statistics and quantitative analysis in biology.",

We explored the possibility of differential vulnerability to habitat area reduction in relation to species-specific and food-web traits by comparing species–area regression slopes. Moreover, we searched for a synergistic effect of these traits and of trophic level . We collected mined leaves and recorded plant, leaf miner, and parasitoid species interactions in five 100-m2 transects in 19 Chaco Serrano woodland remnants in central Argentina. Species were classified into extreme categories according to body size, natural abundance, trophic breadth, and trophic level. Species–area slopes differed between groups with extreme values of natural abundance or trophic specialization. Nevertheless, synergistic effects of life-history and food-web traits were only found for trophic level and trophic breadth: area-related species loss was highest for specialist parasitoids. It has been suggested that species position within interaction webs could determine their vulnerability to extinction. Our results provide evidence that food-web parameters, such as trophic level and trophic breadth, affect species sensitivity to habitat fragmentation.",

Measuring body size provides a relatively simple means of encapsulating and condensing a large amount of the biological information embedded within an ecological network. Recently, important advances have been made by incorporating body size into theoretical models that explore food web stability, the patterning of energy fluxes, and responses to perturbations. Because metabolic constraints underpin body-size scaling relationships, metabolic theory offers a potentially useful new framework within which to develop novel models to describe the structure and functioning of ecological networks and to assess the probable consequences of biodiversity change.",

		"abstract": "Local extinctions have cascading effects on ecosystem functions, yet little is known about the potential for the rapid evolutionary change of species in human-modified scenarios. We show that the functional extinction of large-gape seed dispersers in the Brazilian Atlantic forest is associated with the consistent reduction of the seed size of a keystone palm species. Among 22 palm populations, areas deprived of large avian frugivores for several decades present smaller seeds than nondefaunated forests, with negative consequences for palm regeneration. Coalescence and phenotypic selection models indicate that seed size reduction most likely occurred within the past 100 years, associated with human-driven fragmentation. The fast-paced defaunation of large vertebrates is most likely causing unprecedented changes in the evolutionary trajectories and community composition of tropical forests.",

		"abstract": "Both the magnitude and the urgency of the task of assessing global biodiversity require that we make the most of what we know through the use of estimation and extrapolation. Likewise, future biodiversity inventories need to be designed around the use of effective sampling and estimation procedures, especially for ‘hyperdiverse’ groups of terrestrial organisms, such as arthropods, nematodes, fungi, and microorganisms. The challenge of estimating patterns of species richness from samples can be separated into (i) the problem of estimating local species richness, and (ii) the problem of estimating the distinctness, or complementarity, of species assemblages. These concepts apply on a wide range of spatial, temporal, and functional scales. Local richness can be estimated by extrapolating species accumulation curves, fitting parametric distributions of relative abundance, or using non-parametric techniques based on the distribution of individuals among species or of species among samples. We present several of these methods and examine their effectiveness for an example data set. We present a simple measure of complementarity, with some biogeographic examples, and outline the difficult problem of estimating complementarity from samples. Finally, we discuss the importance of using ‘reference’ sites (or sub-sites) to assess the true richness and composition of species assemblages, to measure ecologically significant ratios between unrelated taxa, to measure taxon/sub-taxon (hierarchical) ratios, and to ‘calibrate’ standardized sampling methods. This information can then be applied to the rapid, approximate assessment of species richness and faunal or floral composition at ‘comparative’ sites.",

		"abstract": "Abstract: Despite the continuing loss of wetland habitats and associated declines in amphibian populations, attempts to translate wetland losses into measurable losses to ecosystems have been lacking. We estimated the potential productivity from the amphibian community that would be compromised by the loss of a single isolated wetland that has been protected from most industrial, agricultural, and urban impacts for the past 54 years. We used a continuous drift fence at Ellenton Bay, a 10-ha freshwater wetland on the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, South Carolina (U.S.A.), to sample all amphibians for 1 year following a prolonged drought. Despite intensive agricultural use of the land surrounding Ellenton Bay prior to 1951, we documented 24 species and remarkably high numbers and biomass of juvenile amphibians (>360,000 individuals; >1,400 kg) produced during one breeding season. Anurans (17 species) were more abundant than salamanders (7 species), comprising 96.4% of individual captures. Most (95.9%) of the amphibian biomass came from 232095 individuals of a single species of anuran (southern leopard frog[Rana sphenocephala]). Our results revealed the resilience of an amphibian community to natural stressors and historical habitat alteration and the potential magnitude of biomass and energy transfer from isolated wetlands to surrounding terrestrial habitat. We attributed the postdrought success of amphibians to a combination of adult longevity (often >5 years), a reduction in predator abundance, and an abundance of larval food resources. Likewise, the increase of forest cover around Ellenton Bay from <20% in 1951 to >60% in 2001 probably contributed to the long-term persistence of amphibians at this site. Our findings provide an optimistic counterpoint to the issue of the global decline of biological diversity by demonstrating that conservation efforts can mitigate historical habitat degradation.",

These networks have traditionally been studied in isolation, but species are commonly involved in multiple, diverse types of interaction. Therefore, whether different types of species interaction networks coupled through shared species show idiosyncratic or correlated responses to habitat degradation is unresolved. Here we study the collective response of coupled mutualistic networks of plants and their pollinators and seed dispersers to the degradation of Europe’s last relict of old-growth lowland forest (Białowieża, Poland). We show that logging of old-growth forests has correlated effects on the number of partners and interactions of plants in both mutualisms, and that these effects are mediated by shifts in plant densities on logged sites. These results suggest bottom-up-controlled effects of habitat degradation on plant–animal mutualistic networks, and predict that the conversion of primary old-growth forests to secondary habitats may cause a parallel loss of multiple animal-mediated ecosystem services.",

		"abstract": "1 We studied the community and food-web structure of trap-nesting insects in restored meadows and at increasing distances within intensively managed grassland at 13 sites in Switzerland to test if declining species diversity correlates with declining interaction diversity and changes in food-web structure. 2 We analysed 49 quantitative food webs consisting of a total of 1382 trophic interactions involving 39 host/prey insect species and 14 parasitoid/predator insect species. Species richness and abundance of three functional groups, bees and wasps as the lower trophic level and natural enemies as the higher trophic level, were significantly higher in restored than in adjacent intensively managed meadows. Diversity and abundance of specific trophic interactions also declined from restored to intensively managed meadows. 3 The proportion of attacked brood cells and the mortality of bees and wasps due to natural enemies were significantly higher in restored than in intensively managed meadows. Bee abundance and the rate of attacked brood cells of bees declined with increasing distance from restored meadows. These findings indicate that interaction diversity declines more rapidly than species diversity in our study system. 4 Quantitative measures of food-web structure (linkage density, interaction diversity, interaction evenness and compartment diversity) were higher in restored than in intensively managed meadows. This was reflected in a higher mean number of host/prey species per consumer species (degree of generalism) in restored than in intensively managed meadows. 5 The higher insect species and interaction diversity was related to higher plant species richness in restored than in intensively managed meadows. In particular, bees and natural enemies reacted positively to increased plant diversity. 6 Our findings provide empirical evidence for the theoretical prediction that decreasing species richness at lower trophic levels should reduce species richness at higher trophic levels, and in addition lead to even stronger reductions in interaction diversity at these higher levels. Species at higher trophic levels may thus benefit relatively more than species at lower trophic levels from habitat restoration in the grassland ecosystems studied. We also demonstrate enhanced compartment diversity and lower interaction evenness in restored than in intensively managed meadows, both of which are theoretically positively associated with increased ecosystem stability in restored meadows.",

These changes can be broadly grouped according to three nonexclusive mechanisms: (a) changes in the species composition of the networks (driven by interaction patterns of invaders, nonrandom extinction of species according to their traits, or differences among species in population responses across gradients); (b) changes that alter interaction frequencies via changes in search efficiency (driven by altered habitat structure or metabolic rates) or changes in spatial and temporal overlap; and (c) changes to coevolutionary processes and patterns. Taking spatial and temporal processes into account can further elucidate network variation and improve predictions of network responses to environmental change. Emerging evidence links network structure to ecosystem functioning; however, scaling up to metanetworks or multilayer networks may modify interpretations of network structure, stability, and functioning.",

		"abstract": "Worldwide, human appropriation of ecosystems is disrupting plant–pollinator communities and pollination function through habitat conversion and landscape homogenisation. Conversion to agriculture is destroying and degrading semi-natural ecosystems while conventional land-use intensification (e.g. industrial management of large-scale monocultures with high chemical inputs) homogenises landscape structure and quality. Together, these anthropogenic processes reduce the connectivity of populations and erode floral and nesting resources to undermine pollinator abundance and diversity, and ultimately pollination services. Ecological intensification of agriculture represents a strategic alternative to ameliorate these drivers of pollinator decline while supporting sustainable food production, by promoting biodiversity beneficial to agricultural production through management practices such as intercropping, crop rotations, farm-level diversification and reduced agrochemical use. We critically evaluate its potential to address and reverse the land use and management trends currently degrading pollinator communities and potentially causing widespread pollination deficits. We find that many of the practices that constitute ecological intensification can contribute to mitigating the drivers of pollinator decline. Our findings support ecological intensification as a solution to pollinator declines, and we discuss ways to promote it in agricultural policy and practice.",

		"abstract": "Aim The identification of compartments (i.e. clusters of overlapping species ranges across an environmental gradient) is an important methodological challenge for biogeographical studies. Recent developments in network theory offer promising perspectives on this issue using the measurement of modularity. A presence–absence matrix is modular if particular subgroups of species are mainly linked to particular subgroups of sites. Modularity is still rarely considered in biogeographical studies. Here, I compare different modularity indices to investigate which is the most appropriate for studying presence–absence matrices and similar types of networks, such as bipartite networks. Location Evaluation was based on 279 data sets from around the world. Methods I consider the three most commonly used modularity indices. One was developed for unipartite networks and the other two for bipartite networks. The performance of these indices (detection of a modular pattern, quality of compartment identification) is evaluated on test matrices of known compartmentalization levels with varying sizes and fills. Modularity patterns are then evaluated for 279 presence–absence matrices. Results The three modularity measures differ mainly in the identification of the compartments, and less in the statistical significance of the observed modularity. The modularity measure Q3 tends to perform best, whereas Q2 usually performs less well, especially for highly diverse and highly connected networks that include a few extremely well-connected nodes. These modularity indices all reveal the presence of modular patterns in presence–absence matrices. Main conclusions The choice of an appropriate modularity index is particularly important when we are interested in the composition of the different compartments. This analysis suggests that compartmentalized structures can be widespread in presence–absence matrices (about 40% of the matrices considered here). Modularity should thus offer interesting perspectives on the understanding of biogeographical patterns.",

The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks\"--",

		"abstract": "The influence of negative species interactions has dominated much of the literature on community assembly rules. Patterns of negative covariation among species are typically documented through null model analyses of binary presence/absence matrices in which rows designate species, columns designate sites, and the matrix entries indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular species in a particular site. However, the outcome of species interactions ultimately depends on population-level processes. Therefore, patterns of species segregation and aggregation might be more clearly expressed in abundance matrices, in which the matrix entries indicate the abundance or density of a species in a particular site. We conducted a series of benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of 14 candidate null model algorithms and six covariation metrics that can be used with abundance matrices. We first created a series of random test matrices by sampling a metacommunity from a lognormal species abundance distribution. We also created a series of structured matrices by altering the random matrices to incorporate patterns of pairwise species segregation and aggregation. We next screened each algorithm–index combination with the random and structured matrices to determine which tests had low Type I error rates and good power for detecting segregated and aggregated species distributions. In our benchmark tests, the best-performing null model does not constrain species richness, but assigns individuals to matrix cells proportional to the observed row and column marginal distributions until, for each row and column, total abundances are reached. Using this null model algorithm with a set of four covariance metrics, we tested for patterns of species segregation and aggregation in a collection of 149 empirical abundance matrices and 36 interaction matrices collated from published papers and posted data sets. More than 80% of the matrices were significantly segregated, which reinforces a previous meta-analysis of presence/absence matrices. However, using two of the metrics we detected a significant pattern of aggregation for plants and for the interaction matrices (which include plant–pollinator data sets). These results suggest that abundance matrices, analyzed with an appropriate null model, may be a powerful tool for quantifying patterns of species segregation and aggregation.",

However, LPAm favors community divisions where all communities are similar in total degree and thus it is prone to get stuck in poor local maxima in the modularity space. To escape local maxima, we employ a multistep greedy agglomerative algorithm (MSG) that can merge multiple pairs of communities at a time. Combining LPAm and MSG, we propose an advanced modularity-specialized label propagation algorithm (LPAm+). Experiments show that LPAm+ successfully detects communities with higher modularity values than ever reported in two commonly used real-world networks. Moreover, LPAm+ offers a fair compromise between accuracy and speed.",

		"abstract": "Real-world complex networks are composed of non-random quantitative interactions. Identifying communities of nodes that tend to interact more with each other than the network as a whole is a key research focus across multiple disciplines, yet many community detection algorithms only use information about the presence or absence of interactions between nodes. Weighted modularity is a potential method for evaluating the quality of community partitions in quantitative networks. In this framework, the optimal community partition of a network can be found by searching for the partition that maximizes modularity. Attempting to find the partition that maximizes modularity is a computationally hard problem requiring the use of algorithms. QuanBiMo is an algorithm that has been proposed to maximize weighted modularity in bipartite networks. This paper introduces two new algorithms, LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+, for maximizing weighted modularity in bipartite networks. LPAwb+ and DIRTLPAwb+ robustly identify partitions with high modularity scores. DIRTLPAwb+ consistently matched or outperformed QuanBiMo, while the speed of LPAwb+ makes it an attractive choice for detecting the modularity of larger networks. Searching for modules using weighted data (rather than binary data) provides a different and potentially insightful method for evaluating network partitions.",

		"abstract": "Tree cultivation is widely stimulated due to the provision of environmental services by sequestering atmospheric carbon, but forestry is a potential danger to biodiversity, mainly when cultivation replaces originally non-forested landscapes. Due to the rapid expansion of afforestation in grassland ecosystems, we used environmental descriptors and structure of amphibian and reptile communities as a tool to assess the possible effects of forestry on wildlife. We used pitfall traps with drift fences in Eucalyptus afforestation and native grasslands of the Pampa biome from southern Brazil. Amphibians and reptile species richness was lower in afforestation than in native grasslands. Furthermore, the reptile community found in afforestation was a poor subset of the community recorded in native grasslands. Indeed, the structure of communities for both amphibians and reptiles in afforestation was highly dissimilar from the native grasslands, with major environmental descriptors that influenced this difference being related to the structure of undergrowth vegetation, incident light, and sodium concentration in soil. Amphibians and reptiles proved to be an efficient tool to assess the potential impacts effects of afforestation/forestation since the replacement of natural grassland ecosystems by eucalypt afforestation caused detectable negative effects on the diversity of herpetofauna. Biodiversity conservation strategies in non-forest ecosystems are urgently needed and should encompass policies to restrict the expansion of forestry on the remaining native grasslands.",

		"abstract": "Human activities drive biotic homogenization (loss of regional diversity) of many taxa. However, whether species interaction networks (e.g., food webs) can also become homogenized remains largely unexplored. Using 48 quantitative parasitoid–host networks replicated through space and time across five tropical habitats, we show that deforestation greatly homogenized network structure at a regional level, such that interaction composition became more similar across rice and pasture sites compared with forested habitats. This was not simply caused by altered consumer and resource community composition, but was associated with altered consumer foraging success, such that parasitoids were more likely to locate their hosts in deforested habitats. Furthermore, deforestation indirectly homogenized networks in time through altered mean consumer and prey body size, which decreased in deforested habitats. Similar patterns were obtained with binary networks, suggesting that interaction (link) presence–absence data may be sufficient to detect network homogenization effects. Our results show that tropical agroforestry systems can support regionally diverse parasitoid–host networks, but that removal of canopy cover greatly homogenizes the structure of these networks in space, and to a lesser degree in time. Spatiotemporal homogenization of interaction networks may alter coevolutionary outcomes and reduce ecological resilience at regional scales, but may not necessarily be predictable from community changes observed within individual trophic levels.",

		"abstract": "The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.",

Because the duration of their breeding seasons was rather different, the levels of food intake at the respective breeding sites were analysed. We found a positive correlation between the length of the male calling period and the ingestion of prey. The longer the species‐specific reproductive activity of the males, the more individuals fed during that time. The results are discussed under congruence aspects of feeding and mating microhabitats in these tree frogs. In addition, differences in niche breadth may influence the temporal and spatial partitioning between the species studied and result in quantitative as well as qualitative patterns of prey consumption, thereby ensuring a maximum of fitness gain. 1.

Location Our data set includes species from tropical rainforests, semi-arid regions of Brazil, and from deserts of the south-western United States, Australia and the Kalahari of Africa. Methods We calculated phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic regressions among predator body size, dietary breath and various prey size measures. Results We found a negative association between body size and dietary niche breadth in 159 lizard species sampled across most evolutionary lineages of squamate reptiles and across major continents and habitats. We also show that mean, minimum, maximum and range of prey size were positively associated with body size. Main conclusions Our results suggest not only that larger lizards tend to eat larger prey, but in doing so offset their use of smaller prey. Reduction of dietary niche breadth with increased body size in these lizards suggests that large predators target large and more profitable prey. Consequently, the negative association between body size and niche breadth in predators most likely results from optimal foraging. Though this result may appear paradoxical and runs counter to previous studies, resources for predators may be predictably more limited than resources for herbivores, thus driving selection for more profitable prey.",

		"abstract": "Electivity indices measure the utilization of food types (r) in relation to their abundance or availability in the environment (p). Foods that constitute a larger proportion of the diet than of the available foods are considered preferred; conversely those proportionately underrepresented in the diet are avoided. A food is eaten at random if its proportion in the diet equals its proportion in the environment. A family of electivity indices stemming from Ivlev's (1961) classic monograph exist and differ only in the particular algorithm used to calculate electivity from r and p. For each available index I graphed the values of electivity as contours for all combinations of r and p. These graphs are compared to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each index on the basis of the following criteria: 1) the value of the index when r = p for a food, 2) the symmetry of the electivity value as feeding deviates from random, 3) the possible range of index values, 4) the linearity of changes in electivity over the full range of r and p, 5) the sensitivity of the index to sampling errors, 6) the statistical testability of the electivity, and 7) the stability of the electivity value for a food type that changes relative abundance or occurs in combination with different food types. No one index ideally satisfies all the criteria. The host preferences of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, feeding on tree foliage in an undisturbed deciduous forest in southwestern Quebec, Canada were used to compare the available indices: Ivlev's electivity, E; Ivlev's forage ratio, E′; Jacob's modified electivity, D; Jacob's modified forage ratio, log Q; Chesson's alpha; Strauss' linear index, L; and Vanderploeg and Scavia's relativized electivity, E*. The electivity values calculated by each index differ one from another; host trees shown as preferred by one index will frequently appear avoided according to an alternative index. The rank order electivities for the 19 available host trees, however, are remarkably similar for all but Strauss' linear index, L. Populus grandidentata, Quercus rubra, Ostrya virginiana, and Amelanchier were the most preferred host trees in the sampled forest; Prunus serotina, Acer pensylvanicum, A. rubrum, Betula lutea, and Fraxinus americana were most avoided. The use of Vanderploeg and Scavia's E* index is recommended.",

Empirical support for these models is variable, suggesting that additional mechanisms of resource partitioning may be important in sustaining large-herbivore diversity in African savannas. We used DNA metabarcoding to conduct a taxonomically explicit analysis of large-herbivore diets across southeastern Africa, analyzing ∼4,000 fecal samples of 30 species from 10 sites in seven countries over 6 y. We detected 893 food plant taxa from 124 families, but just two families—grasses and legumes—accounted for the majority of herbivore diets. Nonetheless, herbivore species almost invariably partitioned food plant taxa; diet composition differed significantly in 97% of pairwise comparisons between sympatric species, and dissimilarity was pronounced even between the strictest grazers (grass eaters), strictest browsers (nongrass eaters), and closest relatives at each site. Niche differentiation was weakest in an ecosystem recovering from catastrophic defaunation, indicating that food plant partitioning is driven by species interactions, and was stronger at low rainfall, as expected if interspecific competition is a predominant driver. Diets differed more between browsers than grazers, which predictably shaped community organization: Grazer-dominated trophic networks had higher nestedness and lower modularity. That dietary differentiation is structured along taxonomic lines complements prior work on how herbivores partition plant parts and patches and suggests that common mechanisms govern herbivore coexistence and community assembly in savannas.",

		"abstract": "The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist1 and Hartley2 on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.",

		"abstract": "The forage ratio and Ivlev's electivity index are common measures to quantity food selection but the values of both indices depend not only on the extent of selection but also on the relative abundances of the food types in the environment. They are therefore useless when food types with different relative abundances are compared, or when the relation between selection and relative abundance is studied. Modified versions of both indices are proposed which are based directly on the rates of decrement (mortality) of the food due to feeding, and are independent of the relative abundance.",

		"abstract": "The robustness of quantitative measures of compositional dissimilarity between sites was evaluated using extensive computer simulations of species' abundance patterns over one and two dimensional configurations of sample sites in ecological space. Robustness was equated with the strength over a range of models, of the linear and monotonic (rank-order) relationship between the compositional dissimilarities and the corresponding Euclidean distances between sites measured in the ecological space. The range of models reflected different assumptions about species' response curve shape, sampling pattern of sites, noise level of the data, species' interactions, trends in total site abundance, and beta diversity of gradients.The Kulczynski, Bray-Curtis and Relativized Manhattan measures were found to have not only a robust monotonic relationship with ecological distance, but also a robust linear (proportional) relationship until ecological distances became large. Less robust measures included Chord distance, Kendall's coefficient, Chisquared distance, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance.A new ordination method, hybrid multidimensional scaling (HMDS), is introduced that combines metric and nonmetric criteria, and so takes advantage of the particular properties of robust dissimilarity measures such as the Kulczynski measure.",
